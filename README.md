## Agent Jump
- **PLATFORM**: Windows
- **LANGUAGE**: C++

Doodle Jump clone made with Sumo Digital Academy's [playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer) framework.


Features:
- [x] Infinite platform generation that gets more difficult the higher up you go
- [x] Random placement of springs to boost you further

**Planned...**:

- [x] Make the camera update more smoothly. At the moment it's a bit jarring, especially when the player bounces.
- [x] Add a power up to the game that makes you jump higher. Allow the player to have a set amount of powerups. Add a little UI icon somewhere to indicate what power ups you currently have.
- [ ] Add a 'jetpack' . When the player collides with it, for a set amount of time they'll be propelled upwards
- [ ] Maybee, add some extra platforms that will break upon collision, without propelling the player forward, as a trap for the player. Make sure to add them horizontally-ish to existing platforms to avoid creating a situation where the only way to go up is a breakable platform. Main challenge for this feature would be the art for it, I'm horrible at drawing.
